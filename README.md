flutter_project
This Flutter project provides a starting point for building mobile applications.

This Cartio project implements a mobile application using flutter with the following API: https://fakestoreapi.com/products 
The API returns a list of products. Displays the products as a card containing: 
     Name of the product 
     Price
     Category 
     Image 
     Rating of the product
    
----------------------------------------
Getting Started
This project provides a pre-built lib directory containing the essential codebase for the application. You can replace it with your own project's lib directory to begin development.
--------------------------------
Here are some resources to get you started with Flutter:

Lab: Write your first Flutter app: https://docs.flutter.dev/
Cookbook: Useful Flutter samples: https://docs.flutter.dev/cookbook
For comprehensive tutorials, samples, API references, and mobile development guidance, refer to the official Flutter documentation: https://docs.flutter.dev/
--------------------------------------
Project Setup
Replace the lib directory: Copy your project's lib directory containing your Flutter code into this project's root directory.
Run flutter pub get: This command downloads any required dependencies for your project.
Connect your device (optional): Connect your Android device or iPhone to your computer for direct app testing.
Run the app:
Android: Use flutter run -d <device> where <device> is the name of your connected Android device. You might need to configure the Android development environment beforehand.
iOS: Development on iPhones may require Xcode. Refer to the official Flutter documentation for iOS setup.
Note: This project uses the Chrome DevTools for a quick preview of the app. However, for a more realistic experience, it's recommended to test on a physical device.
